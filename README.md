Rust Library: SSH Command Execution on Proxmox and Remote Linux Servers

üîê Proxmox Remote Command Executor ‚Äì User Manual

üß© Overview
------------

The Proxmox Remote Command Executor is a lightweight and cross-platform Rust library that enables developers and DevOps engineers to securely execute Linux shell commands directly on a Proxmox VE host machine via SSH. It is designed to work across Windows and Linux systems with minimal setup, making it ideal for automation scripts, remote diagnostics, configuration management, or administrative tasks on a Proxmox server.

üöÄ Key Features
------------------------

Cross-Platform Support

Fully compatible with both Windows and Linux/macOS environments, making it versatile for development and production usage.

Secure Password Prompting

Utilizes hidden input prompts for secure password entry during test or execution without exposing credentials in logs or code.

Asynchronous Execution

Built on Rust's async ecosystem (tokio), ensuring non-blocking execution, suitable for scalable tools and scripts.

Custom SSH Executable Support

On Windows, users can override the default OpenSSH binary path if needed, enhancing compatibility across environments.

Password & Passwordless SSH Modes

Supports traditional SSH with password authentication and passwordless SSH (e.g., using SSH keys), providing flexibility for all environments.

Robust Error Handling

Includes detailed runtime status reporting (success, failure, or execution error), helping users quickly identify connection or command issues.

Library-Oriented Design

Built as a reusable Rust crate, it can be easily integrated into larger systems, automation frameworks, or command-line tools.

üîß Use Cases
------------------------

System Administration

Run health checks, start/stop services, or collect diagnostic logs from a remote Proxmox host without logging into the web interface.

CI/CD Pipeline Automation

Integrate remote command execution into continuous delivery workflows for post-deployment validation or system configuration.

DevOps Tools

Embed this utility in custom toolchains used for managing infrastructure, triggering backups, or updating packages.

Security & Compliance Checks

Execute audit commands to validate system compliance or user activity from a centralized admin environment.

Remote Monitoring

Combine with monitoring tools to collect output from commands like uptime, df -h, top, or custom monitoring scripts.

‚úÖ Advantages
------------------------

Lightweight & Fast

Built with Rust for maximum performance, low memory overhead, and blazing-fast execution.

Secure by Design

Avoids exposing passwords; leverages system SSH with minimal attack surface and follows best practices for remote connections.

Customizable & Extensible

Easy to integrate with existing infrastructure, customizable SSH behavior, and extendable for advanced usage.

No Proxmox API Dependency

Unlike API-based solutions, this library doesn‚Äôt depend on Proxmox-specific APIs, making it more universal and simple to use.

Safe Testing Support

Built-in testability allows developers to test command execution securely without exposing sensitive data.

üìå Requirements
------------------------

OpenSSH should be installed and accessible from system PATH (automatically handled for Linux/macOS).

For Windows, OpenSSH path can be provided if not using the default.

SSH must be enabled on the Proxmox host server.

A user account (e.g., root@pam) with appropriate permissions must be available.

üîê Security Recommendations
------------------------------------

Use SSH key authentication in production for better security and automation.

Store credentials securely using environment variables, secret managers, or keyring tools.

Avoid hardcoding passwords or IPs directly in code.

Always validate the remote host fingerprint or use managed SSH configurations.

üì¶ Deployment Suggestions
------------------------------------

Package this as part of an internal DevOps toolkit.

Run in GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines for remote server automation.

Embed into CLI apps to provide an interface for non-technical users.

üìù Support & Contributions
------------------------------------

This tool is designed to simplify remote command execution securely. Community contributions are welcome for improving features, testing in more environments, and enhancing security layers like encrypted password stores or SSH key integrations.

Feel free to submit issues, suggestions, or pull requests on GitHub to help improve this tool for everyone.
